<!-- Answers -->
1. Recursion in Data Structures and Algorithms refers to a programming technique where a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem, often by calling itself.

2. Characteristics of Recursion:
Involves a function calling itself to solve a problem.
Requires a base case to terminate the recursion.
Breaks complex problems into smaller, similar sub-problems.
Can lead to concise and elegant solutions, but may be less efficient in some cases.
Examples of Recursion Applications:

3. Calculating factorials or Fibonacci numbers.
Traversing tree and graph structures.
Solving maze and puzzle problems.
Recursive sorting algorithms like Quicksort and Mergesort.
Depth-first search and backtracking algorithms.
